# Expo Camera Styling Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using custom styles with the Expo Camera component. The preview may not render correctly, or some features may not work as expected if styles are not applied correctly or conflict with Expo's internal styling. The bug is specifically related to styling issues, where the preview area does not show up or displays incompletely when custom styling is applied to the component.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected approach.
